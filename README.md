Kerala, a state on India's tropical Malabar Coast, has nearly 600km of Arabian Sea shoreline. It's known for its palm-lined beaches and backwaters, a network of canals. Inland are the Western Ghats, mountains whose slopes support tea, coffee and spice plantations as well as wildlife. National parks like Eravikulam and Periyar, plus Wayanad and other sanctuaries, are home to elephants, langur monkeys and tigers.
Kerala's most celebrated festivals include the harvest festival Onam, known for boat races, flower carpets, and traditional feasts, and the vibrant Thrissur Pooram, a temple festival famous for its elaborately decorated elephants, music, and fireworks. Other notable celebrations include the Sabarimala Temple festival and religious holidays like Deepavali and Eid-ul-Fitr, which are observed by diverse communities in the state.
